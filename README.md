# Market Crash Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the stock performance of three major financial institutions—CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase—during the market crash of 2008. The analysis spans from 2006 to 2016, with a detailed look at how the 2008 financial crisis impacted these banks.

## Overview

The goal of the project is to explore how the stock prices of these banks fluctuated before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis. By examining historical stock data, the analysis helps to understand the volatility and overall trends of these institutions during one of the most turbulent financial periods in recent history.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock data for CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase was collected from a financial data provider (Stooq). The data includes stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close) and trading volumes.

2. **Data Preparation**: The data was reversed to ensure it was in chronological order. Labels were created for each bank’s stock to organize the information and make it easier to work with.

3. **Maximum and Minimum Prices**: For each bank, the highest and lowest closing stock prices during the 10-year period were identified to highlight key moments of performance.

4. **Return Calculation**: Daily stock returns were computed for each bank to measure how much their stock prices changed day-to-day. This allowed for a deeper understanding of the stock volatility and performance.

5. **Best and Worst Days**: The analysis identified the best and worst single-day performances for each bank. For instance, the worst days were generally around the peak of the financial crisis in early 2009.

6. **Volatility Analysis**: The standard deviation of stock returns was calculated to measure the risk associated with each bank’s stock. CitiGroup showed the highest volatility, making it the most risky investment among the three during this period.

7. **Visualization**: Various graphs were created to visually represent the stock trends and volatility during the market crash. This included plotting the stock prices over time and visualizing the distribution of returns to see how extreme the fluctuations were during key periods like 2008 and 2015.

## Insights

- **CitiGroup** had the most volatile stock during this time, which reflected the significant impact the crash had on the bank.
- **Goldman Sachs** and **JPMorgan Chase** also experienced substantial fluctuations, though not as severe as CitiGroup.
- The financial crisis caused extreme movements in the stock market, with both major gains and losses occurring over very short periods, highlighting the unpredictable nature of the market during crises.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into how three of the largest financial institutions were impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Through stock price analysis, return calculations, and volatility assessments, we can better understand the risks and rewards associated with banking stocks during a period of economic instability.
